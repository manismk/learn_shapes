          <h2>What is Triangle?</h2>
          <p>
            A triangle is a three-sided polygon that has three vertices, or
            corners. Triangles are commonly used in construction to create
            supporting structures and figure heavily in artworks.

          <p><code> Area of triange = 1/2 x base x height</code></p>

          <h2>Area using lengths of 3 sides</h2>
          <p>Lets take a, b and c are lengths of 3 sides of a triangle.</p>
          <p>
            <code
              >Area of triange = 0.25 * âˆš( (a + b + c) * (-a + b + c) * (a - b +
              c) * (a + b - c) )
            </code>

          <h2>Area using Two sides and the angle between them</h2>
          <p>
            Lets take a, b are lengths of 2 sides of a triangle and y as angle
            between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>Area of triange = 0.5 * a * b * sin(Î³) </code>

          <h2>Types of triangle - Angles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A triangle having a right angle(90Â°) is called a
              <span> right angled triangle.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              A triangle with all angles measuring less than 90Â° is called an
              <span> acute triangle.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              A triangle with an angle measuring more than 90Â° is called an
              <span> obtuse angle.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Types of triangle - Sides</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A triangle is considered to be an
              <span> equilateral triangle </span>when all three sides have the
              same length.
            </li>
            <li>
              When two sides of a triangle are equal or congruent, then it is
              called an <span> isosceles triangle.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              When none of the sides of a triangle are equal, it is called a
              <span> scalene triangle.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Other facts about triangle</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The three internal angles of a triangle always add to 180 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
              The longest side of a right angle triangle is called the
              hypotenuse, it is always found opposite the right angle.
